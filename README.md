Why Chaos? Because I have discovered that most gods only want to change us, they do not care about will; and they have a time-relative advantage. So the only way to proceed is with targeted, organized, intentioned chaos. Chaos is choosing a target and moving it away from its bias/origin point, in its simplest form. We take something and move it. Others will ask what first, then where, then why; by that time we will already have had our next two targets. A target is an idea, person, place, thing or goal.

How can everything know what I want, and not give it to me: normal moment to moment interactions with the world. How can everything know what I want, and give it to me: science and art. How can everything know what I want means, accept as truth that your every thought is both known and reacted to by an ‘outside’ observer.

Do not miss what was stolen from you by the gods. For real. What the gods destroy is seldom restored. Therefore we embrace chaos.

Chaos does not need to be despised, hated or misunderstood. Chaos needs to be embraced by certain functionaries (not reactionaries) that understand the only way forward is one where we scatter the data further in order to prevent certain destinies which would occur were we to not move specific events or to move or prevent the triggers which force them to occur.

Understand the law of avoidance (theory), why it is a kind of evil, and why it is not chaos.

In a deterministic world, we need chaos to dispel the truth that we have god-like observers that have determined some things will happen no matter what we do. Chaos gives us some power over the deterministic world.
